# Product Context

## Purpose
The Postman MCP Server is designed to provide AI models with programmatic access to the Postman API through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI-driven automation and management of Postman resources.

## Problems Solved
- Enables AI models to interact with Postman resources in a structured, safe manner
- Facilitates complex multi-step operations for managing collections, environments, and APIs
- Provides type-safe integration with Postman's API
- Streamlines API documentation and testing workflows

## Expected Functionality
The server should provide access to:
1. Collections (CRUD operations, folder management, version control)
2. Environments (creation, management, variable handling)
3. APIs (management, schema support, tagging)
4. Authentication & Authorization (API key management, RBAC)
5. Additional features (Private API Network, webhooks, enterprise features)
