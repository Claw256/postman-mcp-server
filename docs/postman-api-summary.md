# Postman API Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the core Postman API functionality implemented in our MCP server tools, mapped against the OpenAPI specification.

## Workspaces

### Implemented Operations
- Get all workspaces (`GET /workspaces`)
- Get a specific workspace (`GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}`)
- Create workspace (`POST /workspaces`)
- Update workspace (`PUT /workspaces/{workspaceId}`)
- Delete workspace (`DELETE /workspaces/{workspaceId}`)

### Key Features
- Support for workspace types: personal, team, private, public, partner
- Workspace visibility control
- Basic workspace metadata (name, description)
- Workspace resource listings (collections, environments, mocks, monitors, APIs)

## Collections

### Implemented Operations
- Get all collections (`GET /collections`)
- Get a specific collection (`GET /collections/{collectionId}`)
- Create collection (`POST /collections`)
- Update collection (`PUT /collections/{collectionId}`)
- Delete collection (`DELETE /collections/{collectionId}`)

### Key Features
- Collection CRUD operations
- Support for Postman Collection Format v2.1.0
- Collection metadata management
- Basic collection content operations

## Environments

### Implemented Operations
- Get all environments (`GET /environments`)
- Get a specific environment (`GET /environments/{environmentId}`)
- Create environment (`POST /environments`)
- Update environment (`PUT /environments/{environmentId}`)
- Delete environment (`DELETE /environments/{environmentId}`)

### Key Features
- Environment CRUD operations
- Environment variable management
- Support for secret and default variable types
- Basic environment metadata management

## Users

### Implemented Operations
- Get authenticated user info (`GET /me`)

### Key Features
- Basic user information retrieval
- User role information
- Team membership details
- Usage limits and statistics

## Core Implementation Details

### Authentication
- API Key authentication via `x-api-key` header
- Support for SCIM API key authentication

### Error Handling
- Standard HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages and types
- Consistent error response format

### Common Features
- Pagination support via cursor-based pagination
- Resource metadata handling
- Workspace-scoped operations
- Basic CRUD operations for main resources

## Not Implemented

The following major API features are not currently implemented in our MCP server:

1. Advanced Collection Operations:
   - Collection forking
   - Collection merging
   - Pull requests
   - Collection access keys

2. Mock Servers:
   - Mock server creation and management
   - Server response handling
   - Mock call logs

3. Monitors:
   - Monitor creation and management
   - Monitor runs
   - Monitor statistics

4. API Management:
   - API versioning
   - API schemas
   - API security validation

5. Advanced Features:
   - Webhooks
   - Audit logs
   - Team billing and accounts
   - Private API Network features

## Notes

This implementation focuses on the core CRUD operations for the main Postman resources (workspaces, collections, environments) and basic user information. It provides the essential functionality needed for basic Postman API integration while leaving out more advanced features that can be added as needed.

The implementation follows Postman's API structure and authentication mechanisms while maintaining a simplified approach focused on the most commonly used operations.
