## Notes

### API Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive coverage of the Postman API, including:

1. Core Resource Management
   - Workspaces (personal, team, private, public, partner)
   - Collections with Postman Collection Format v2.1.0 support
   - Environments with variable management
   - APIs with schema version control
   - Mock servers with response simulation
   - Monitors with scheduled runs

2. Version Control Features
   - Forking capabilities for collections and environments
   - Merge and pull operations
   - Git repository integration for APIs
   - Version history tracking
   - Pull request workflows

3. Enterprise Features
   - Private API Network management
   - Secret scanning and management
   - Audit logging
   - Advanced role-based access control
   - Team-level controls
   - Tag management across resources

4. Security Features
   - API security validation with OWASP rules
   - Secret detection and resolution
   - Role-based access control
   - Workspace visibility controls
   - Authentication options (API key, SCIM)

5. Collaboration Features
   - Comments system across resources
   - Thread-based discussions
   - Role and permission management
   - Team workspaces
   - Resource sharing controls

### Implementation Patterns

1. Consistent Resource Management
   - CRUD operations follow standard patterns
   - Workspace-scoped resources
   - Standardized metadata handling
   - Common error patterns
   - Versioning support

2. Flexible Pagination
   - Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - Limit/offset pagination where appropriate
   - Consistent parameter naming
   - Clear pagination metadata

3. Error Handling
   - Standard HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error messages
   - Domain-specific error types
   - Clear error resolution guidance

4. Asynchronous Operations
   - Task-based tracking
   - Status polling endpoints
   - Clear completion indicators
   - Timeout handling

5. API Versioning
   - Version headers required
   - Clear version dependencies
   - Backward compatibility notes
   - Version-specific features

### Best Practices

1. Resource Organization
   - Logical endpoint grouping
   - Clear resource relationships
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Proper resource scoping

2. Security Implementation
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Enterprise security features
   - Audit trail maintenance

3. Performance Considerations
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Async operations for long-running tasks
   - Resource size limits
   - Rate limiting support

4. Documentation
   - Clear endpoint descriptions
   - Request/response examples
   - Error documentation
   - Feature availability notes

### Key Considerations

1. Enterprise vs Standard Features
   - Clear feature availability marking
   - Plan-specific endpoint behavior
   - Enterprise-only capabilities
   - Feature access control

2. Resource Limitations
   - Collection size limits (20MB)
   - Comment length limits (10,000 chars)
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Plan-based restrictions

3. Version Control
   - Git integration capabilities
   - Fork and merge workflows
   - Version history management
   - Change tracking

4. Authentication & Authorization
   - Multiple auth methods
   - Role-based access
   - Resource permissions
   - Team-level controls

This implementation provides a robust and feature-rich API that supports both basic usage patterns and advanced workflows through version control, security features, and team collaboration tools. The API is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, with clear documentation and consistent patterns throughout.
